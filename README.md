# functionality_Three
Added Endpoints on localhost:port/folders/{variable}?howmany. The variable can be one of these (files, folders, length), howmany indicates how many top files the user wants returned. Sadly the endings do not have any ui because it is quite late and I wanted to finish all functions so they work at least.
